# Silenced

The main theme of the film "Silenced" employs a deep, heavy string melody to poignantly portray the pain experienced by hearing-impaired children and the societal silence surrounding their suffering. Rather than exaggerating the scenes, the music conveys sorrow with a restrained emotional tone, allowing the audience to engage more sincerely with the charactersâ€™ anguish. Through its somber and minimalist approach, the score deepens the emotional resonance of the film, emphasizing the gravity of the injustice and the need for awareness and change.
